# Session logs

One file per working session: what changed, how it was done, and what verified it.
These are the *narrative* record. For the user-facing summary of a change read
[../simulator/CHANGELOG.md](../simulator/CHANGELOG.md); for the conventions and
gotchas you need before editing read [../simulator/HANDOVER.md](../simulator/HANDOVER.md).

**Naming:** `SessionLog_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<Topic-In-Kebab-Case>.md`, so the directory
sorts chronologically. Screenshots and other evidence live here too, named
`<YYYY-MM-DD>_<what-it-shows>.png` — keep them next to the log that cites them.

| Session | Topic | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [2026-08-20](SessionLog_2026-08-20_Astigmatic-Beams-Caustic-VRuns.md) | Astigmatic beams + caustic V-runs | Written on a **different machine**, against a pre-reorg copy that predates the `cylens` commit (`4a162b6`). Its `beam.qv` design was **never merged** — see the Part 1 audit in the 08-21 log for why, and for the one place it was physically wrong. Kept as the spec that work was reimplemented from. |
| [2026-08-21](SessionLog_2026-08-21_Astigmatic-Source-PerAxis-Readouts-VRun-Stitch.md) | Astigmatic source, per-axis readouts, V-run stitch | Audit of the above, then items 1–5 reimplemented on the local `beam.qa` design. Includes a design reversal: the axis-exchange discontinuity shipped in `df75d1d` and was corrected in `32797a2`. |

## Evidence

| File | Shows |
|---|---|
| [2026-08-21_axis-exchange-jump.png](2026-08-21_axis-exchange-jump.png) | The bug reported against `df75d1d`: naming the caustic curves by *board orientation* made them trade values at a 90° periscope, a ~65% vertical step mid-plot. |
| [2026-08-20_continuous-caustic-wanted.png](2026-08-20_continuous-caustic-wanted.png) | The continuous shape that was wanted instead, and that `32797a2` restored — each curve following one physical axis end to end. |
